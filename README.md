# **Student Performance Prediction**

This is a Machine Learning Data Science program that basically predicts student performance for a specific test. It takes in multiple factors in order to correctly anticipate student performance index. It uses a highly advanced mathematical technique called linear Regression.

## **What this projects includes**

This project offers a number of different products representations and utilities:


1.   It offers the code for the actual model, the code which trains the model and the code which verifies the model
2.   This includes instructions on the implementation of the model, it shows how this code can be implemented into different applications with a mere three lines of configuration.
3.   This project provides visualisation of the data using many types of plots all powered by seaborn.


## **How it can be used?**

This code can be used for many things, wether you are a developer and need a student performance model integrated into your website or wether you are a student who needs to forecast their next grade this model has you covered.
